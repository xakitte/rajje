It lies between latitudes 1째S and 8째N, and longitudes 72째 and 74째E. The atolls are composed of live coral reefs and sand bars, situated atop a submarine ridge 960 kilometres (600 mi) long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean and runs north to south. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives#Geography">More..</a></p><h3>Culture</h3><p>Since the 12th century AD there were also influences from Arabia in the language and culture of the Maldives because of the conversion to Islam and its location as a crossroads in the central Indian Ocean. This was due to the long trading history between the far east and the middle east. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives#Culture">More..</a></p></article><nav><h3>Maldives and Life</h3><a href="/history">History of the Maldives</a><a href="/geography">Geography of the Maldives</a><a href="/culture">Culture of the Maldives</a></nav><footer>&copy; 2017 Dhivehi Rajje         </footer></body></html>
